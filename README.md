Introduction
Clustering wine based on chemical analysis of the wines. Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where we get information from datasets without labeled responses. It is a way to find meaningful structure, explanatory underlying processes, generative features, and groupings in a set of data. In this project, we will be trying to group the wines based on their features.
Why it’s important: Clustering is used in all industries and can broadly be used to find patterns and trends in data. We can also learn more about wine in the process! Impress your friends with your palate! And parents!
Description
The goal of this project is to cluster wines based on several chemical constituents such as alcohol, malic acid, ash, etc. Questions that we hope to answer include, but are not limited to:
What patterns can we observe when clustering by various chemical attributes? 
How can we develop a model to cluster wines with a reasonable degree of accuracy? What chemical features seem to be most predictive of the groupings?
 
...and many more to be thought of!
This is an exploratory project, so feel free to bring up anything you would like answered or explored! The scope of this project is not yet set in stone.

Goals
Acquaint members with the basic structure and timeline of a data science project
Provide members with practical, hands-on experience in tools commonly used in industry and research: clustering and unsupervised learning models
Identify key chemical differences in three types of wine and how they are classified
Understand how 
Build an interactive data visualization ⁠to show results
Publish results and visualization 
Have fun and learn something! :)
